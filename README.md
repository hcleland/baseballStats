# Batter Up

## What is it?

### Nashville Software School Backend Capstone Project
Data and baseball go hand in hand. For this project I wanted to build something that revolved around various pieces of connected data. Inspiration struck at my son's baseball practice. With this app users can store a player's baseball stastistics for each game of the season.

### Intended Audience

Parents of baseball players & coaches of baseball players

## Built With

* .NET MVC with Entity and Identity Frameworks
* Bootswatch style template - Joural (https://bootswatch.com/journal/)
